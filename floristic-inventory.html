                <b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b>
            </p>
            <p class="no-gap text-gray-700 mb-1">
                My master’s thesis was more than a research project; it was a three-year immersion into the vast and rugged landscapes of east-central Idaho. Spanning approximately 27,000 square kilometers, the floristic inventory was my effort to document the remarkable plant diversity of the region. I surveyed portions of seven mountain ranges, exploring forests, rangelands, wetlands, and alpine summits. Each day in the field revealed species I'd never seen before.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The volume of specimens and geographic area of this project far surpasses that of typical botanical inventories. I finished the project with 1,349 unique taxa identified from 11,237 specimens. While surveying, I often reached a local high point that rewarded me with expansive views stretching out to each horizon – all of it my study area.

            <p class="no-gap text-gray-700">
                <b>FIELD METHODS</b>
            </p>
            <p class="no-gap text-gray-700 mb-1">
                My summers were a frantic cycle: one or two days spent collecting specimens, followed by one or two days pressing them. Dr. Ron Hartman supplied me with a custom-built rack that could dry over 250 specimens in just a few days. Plants were not identified until after each summer, and this streamlined the process of collecting and pressing. Synthesizing findings from previous botanical records, aerial imagery, and a variety of geospatial data, I divided my effort across the study area to minimize ecological and spatial gaps. Individual surveys followed a hike route that optimized the number of different habitats traversed. Disturbed areas such as campgrounds, roadsides and abandoned fields were also surveyed for their potential to host novel, non-native species.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                          
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The combination of broad scale and fine scale approaches enabled high species turnover (beta diversity) within surveys, and high species richness (gamma diversity) for the overall project. Although statistical analysis of species distributions or geospatial relationships was not a component of my thesis, I attempted to demonstrate the opportunity to do so by plotting survey sites both geographically and in environmental space (examples below).

                Field work sharpened my botanical eye. Although I began the project with basic knowledge of local plant genera, my true growth was in learning to recognize subtle variations in plants and populations. I collected and pressed everything, from tiny annuals to pine trees, and from cacti to poison ivy. The various shapes and sizes of specimens were not conducive to being flattened onto a 29x41 cm herbarium sheet. With some ingenuity, I utilized various techniques to ensure plant materials were well preserved and demonstrated diagnostic features. For example, thick stems had to be sliced thin on one side, tree twigs shaved down on one side, and tall stems folded accordion style to fit on an herbarium sheet.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed my-4">
                The repetition of collecting every species in each new location was crucial. It wasn’t until I was back in the lab, keying out plants at the end of each summer, that I truly began to see the finer distinctions–discovering the subtle differences between cryptic and similar appearing taxa that had eluded me in the field. The process of discovery and pattern recognition became the foundation of my expertise, honed over three years of intense fieldwork.

                The project was a masterclass in travel to remote, unfamiliar locations. I relied on my personal vehicle, a low-clearance Honda Civic that was otherwise inappropriate for Idaho’s back roads. For many target locations, I had to weigh road conditions and vehicle capability against the extra time needed to walk along 4-wheel drive roads. Physical demands were also intense with most surveys taking me across dangerous scree slopes, up to a thousand meters of elevation gain, through lightning storms and close encounters with wildlife.

            </p>
            <p class="no-gap text-gray-700 mb-1">
                I’m especially proud that I documented a previously undescribed species, <i>Polemonium elusum</i>, while completing my project. The species is unique in that it occupies a wide range of habitats but is confined to a small geographic area. While completing my thesis, Dr. Hartman and I collaborated with Rebecca Stubbs to describe the morphologic, geographic and evolutionary significance of the species.

                You may find a digital photocopy of the species publication through open sources on the web or by the link below. Subsequent phylogenetic research has further clarified the relationship of <i>P.elusum</i> with sister species.
